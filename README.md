# ReadMe File Generator 

## Projection Description 

This is a personal implementation of a readme generator. I find that I always seem to neglect my readme files by forgetting them. One

reason for that being is because it's somewhat tedious. So I figured why not create a template that I can run with my program, that

will generate some of the work so I dont have to do it haha.
